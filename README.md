### Simple-currency-exchange-converter-using-Python

I came across a simple online tutorial for how to create a currency exchange converter using Python. The tutorial can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snPGUT-Fxa4).
It makes use of the [Frankfurter API](https://github.com/hakanensari/frankfurter). In their own words they are an an *open-source API for current and historical foreign exchange rates published by the European Central Bank*.
The project itself was and introduced me to Python's Requests library.
