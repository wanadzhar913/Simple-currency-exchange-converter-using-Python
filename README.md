### Simple-currency-exchange-converter-using-Python

I came across a simple online tutorial on creating a currency exchange converter using Python. The tutorial can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snPGUT-Fxa4). It makes use of the [Frankfurter API](https://github.com/hakanensari/frankfurter). In their own words, Frankfurter API are an:

*"Open-source API for current and historical foreign exchange rates published by the European Central Bank (ECB)."*

I have since modified the code with more robust exception handling and limited the currencies that can be converted (as per ECB's list of available currencies).
