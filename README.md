### Simple-currency-exchange-converter-using-Python

I came across a simple online tutorial for how to create a currency exchange converter using Python. The tutorial can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snPGUT-Fxa4).

It makes use of the [Frankfurter API](https://github.com/hakanensari/frankfurter). In their own words, Frankfurter API are an *open-source API for current and historical foreign exchange rates published by the European Central Bank (ECB)*.

I have since modified the code with more robust exception handling and limited the currencies that can be converted to and from (per ECB's availability). I am currently aiming to add a GUI (Graphical user interface) using Python's tkinter package.
